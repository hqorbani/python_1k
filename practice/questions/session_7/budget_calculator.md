### A 50/30/20 budget, sometimes referred to as the 50/30/20 rule, is a simplified way of budgeting that anyone can do. This type of budget divides every expense into three categories:

### 50% towards Needs
### 30% towards Wants
### 20% towards Saving, Investing & Excess Debt Payoff
### Create a 50/30/20 Budget Calculator to calculate what your monthly budget might look like with this method.
